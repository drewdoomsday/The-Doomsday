	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>Hello! My name is Andrew Philip N. Panahon, but you can call me Drew. I am a rookie IT professional with a strong passion for technology and programming. For over a year, I have gained valuable experience working with C language, and I have also spent the last 6 months honing my skills in Java.</p>
	<p>My expertise lies in technology-related areas, where I have developed a solid understanding and knowledge of various tech concepts and applications. I am particularly skilled in grasping new technologies quickly and applying them effectively in different scenarios.</p>
	<p>As I continue to grow in my career, my goal is to excel in the field of programming while also pursuing my interest in drawing. I believe that a combination of technical proficieny and creative thinking will enable me to innovate and contribute meaningfully to any project I undertake.</p>
	<p>Outside of my professional pursuits, I enjoy playing video games, which not only provide me with relaxation but also inspire my creativity and problem-solving skills.</p>
	<p>I look forward to connecting  and exploring potential opportunities together. :></p>
